For example, I spent a little bit of time getting the plant seeds function to populate the plant array simply because I used lowercase letters in my switch statement rather than capitalizing the seed names and that took some time for me to catch. Also I was helping my teammates with their projects where I almost missed that they forgot to import and call their component function in the main js module. What a way to end the week.",

I was assigned to team Red Jaguar to reproduce something similar to the previous group project of travel brochure except this time the task was to automate much of the html building process into separate JS files. One of our teammates was out for most of the project due to some technical issues however, with our project structure, he was able to finish his page within the first hour or so of class and we managed to finish the project and have retro before lunch. I think it went relatively well! I just finished our daily assignment of taking some data provided by Sarah and creating components out of that data and I read tomorrows assignment, Glassdale Intro",

      "entry": "It's been a while since my last post. A little over a week. I was working on a group project 'Holiday Road' and was assigned to the 'mashed-potatoes' group. We used the tools acquired throughout the course to put this project together but with some twists. This project used different apis. Four, not including the one we were running ourselves via json-server. It was a really fun project and I got to put myself to the test. I got the parks api up and running and Steven got the weather api going. We integrated the data so that the weather api was using gps coords of the parks locations when one was selected so that it would display a five day forecast. I helped him with putting together a multiselect for attractions and eateries even though we didn't use them when saving itineraries but had we more time we could've made that happen. No biggie. Amanda made the ui presentable. Jonah worked on itineraries and I put together the search feature. In the end we only missed two stretch goals which I guess it's not important how many we didn't get rather how many we did get. Also I made some nice spaghetti code. Like Todd Howards likes to say, \"it just works\". Maybe next week I'll get to catch up on some of the other solo projects. I'm looking forward to the next group project, though also nervous because you never know what can go wrong. I may be working with totally different people from before and the next project is considered difficult according to Sarah. I'm still up for the challenge though.",
